This plugin uses clang for accurately completing C and C++ code.

To build and install in one step, type:
$ make install

To build and install in two steps, type:
$ make
$ vim clang_complete.vba -c 'so %' -c 'q'

You need Vim 7.3 or higher, compiled with python support and ideally, with
the conceal feature.

See doc/clang_complete.txt for help and license.
